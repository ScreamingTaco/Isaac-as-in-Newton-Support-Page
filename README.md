# Isaac (as in Newton) Support Page

Isaac (as in Newton) is a physics-based puzzle game that centers around manipulating gravity to reach a goal. Isaac features a minimalistic art style (in case you didn't know, "minimalistic art style" is developer-ese for "I couldn't afford an artist").

Isaac is available on Android and is pending approval on iOS.

Apple requires a support page for iOS apps, so here it is:

### How To Play
The objective of the game is to move the ball from its starting position to the end (the green polygon) by modifying the gravity of the enviroment and the bounciness of the ball.

The area labeled "Y gravity" controls the strength of gravity on the Y axis (up and down). A positive value makes the ball move more downward, and a negative value moves the ball upward.

The area labeled "X gravity" controls the strength of gravity on the X axis (left and right). A positive value makes the ball move towards the right, and a negative value makes the ball move towards the left.

The area labeled "bounce" controls how bouncy the ball is. A value of 10 makes the ball bounce back with the same amount of force. A value of 5 would make the bounce decay, and a value of 20 would make the ball have more force as it bounced.

Red polygons make you start over.

Blue polygons are walls that are affected by gravity in the same way that the ball is, and orange polygons are obstacles that are affected by gravity in the same way that the ball is.

That was a lot to take in, and if you don't understand, then just start playing around with the game and you'll get it eventually. The first four levels are "practice levels"
